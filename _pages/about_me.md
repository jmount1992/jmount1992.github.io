I am a robotics engineer, engineering educator and STEM communicator. I enjoy pushing the boundaries of technology by designing and building robotic systems and assessing their capabilities in real-world applications. I am also passionate about creating and presenting engaging demonstrations to teach others about STEM.

I have worked with universities, governments and the private sector for over five years and completed several highly-successful projects. Some of these include, assessing the readiness of the Australian roads for autonomous vehicles on a multi-million dollar government contract. As well as the development and manufacturing of a fleet of mini-autonomous vehicles that are used for research and education.

My previous roles as a sessional academic at the Queensland University of Technology and as a PhD student as part of the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision have allowed me to explore my passion for education. For the past 10 years, I have taught engineering at QUT and developed engaging demonstrations showing off upcoming robotics technology. This has furthered my communication skill set and provided me with an innovative way to bring all my passions together. Some of my career highlights include guest-starring in several children's television shows and presenting an interactive demonstration about autonomous vehicles to an audience of a thousand people.

I would love to build ever more sophisticated robots, like Disney's Robotic Stuntman, as well as continue to create and deliver engaging presentations that help teach the public about all things "technology". I hold a PhD in the field of robotics.
