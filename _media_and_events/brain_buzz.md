In 2018 I was a guest presenter on Brain Buzz, a children's TV show produced by Channel Nine. We explored what makes up an autonomous vehicle and talked about some of the research developments coming out of the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision. We ran a demonstration that showed how poor weather conditions can wreak havoc on state-of-the-art vision system.
