The project aimed to asses how autonomous vehicles will interact with road infrastructure and the readiness of road infrastructure for autonomous vehicles. My role included management of the data acquistion process as well as the development of software and tools to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the performance of traffic light and sign detection as well as vision and LiDAR-based localisation.
