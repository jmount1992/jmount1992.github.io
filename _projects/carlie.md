Carlie is a mini-autonomous vehicle aimed at making research, education and engaging public demonstrations easier. It was developed by a team of engineers at the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision (ACRV). My role included systems engineering, hardware (mechanical and electrical) design and generation of microcontroller firmware and ROS software. I am a lead engineer on the project and continue to develop the platform and documentation.
