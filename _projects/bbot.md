This Kickstarter project ran in 2016. It was to keep me entertained technically while I read engineering education literature. The aim was to develop an Arduino-based robot that was inexpensive, required no assembly, and could run out-of-the-box with no programming. All you needed to do was flick a switch and could start experimenting with robotics. The project additionally developed several activities that utilised BBot to allow kids to explore the scientific method.
